# Course Island

Course Island is a website I built a while ago using Clojure, PostgreSQL, and Foundation CSS. 

[Course Island](http://192.241.194.172:3001/)

## Running

To start a web server for the application, you would need to build up the database files and find some pictures. This is not a stand-alone project.
